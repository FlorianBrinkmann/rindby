Contributors: FlorianBrinkmann
Requires at least: 4.7
Tested up to: 4.8

== Description ==

The Rindby theme is a simple blogging theme without any extras.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0.0 – 12.07.2017 =

**This version requires at least WordPress 4.7.**

It contains a larger reorganization of functions, so if you
made modifications to the functions.php in a child theme, check it before updating.

Furthermore, the HTML id attributes were changed to classes. So if you used them for
styling adjustments or JS, you have to switch to classes.

**Added**

* RTL styles

**Changed**

* switched to short array syntax []
* Doc improvements
* Reorganization of functions from functions.php into multiple files
* Content width is filterable via `rindby_content_width`
* Use classes for styling instead of ids.
* Removed time from post date.
* Removed author box (maybe better to use a plugin for that, so you will have the box
also after a theme switch).

**Fixed**

* Comments template fixes
